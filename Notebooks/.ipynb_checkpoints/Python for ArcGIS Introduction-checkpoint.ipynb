    "Programming tools are now a standard feature within GIS software packages and allow GIS users to automate, speed up, and become more precise in their data management and analytic work. This workshop is designed for GIS users who have little to no experience with computer programming and will cover core programming concepts related to GIS using the Python programming language. The workshop will focus on guiding participants through hands-on exercises designed to provide the essential skills to programmatically manipulate data as part of a GIS workflow. This workshop is designed to be preparation for the following workshop on **Advanced Python for ArcGIS, but may be taken independently**.\n",
